# Contract Q&A RAG System
Overview
    This repository contains the implementation of a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for Contract Q&A (Question & Answer) tasks. The goal of this project is to build, evaluate, and improve an AI-powered system capable of understanding and responding to questions related to legal contracts.

# Project Structure
    backend/src/: This directory contains the source code for the RAG system implementation. 
    backend/notebooks/: This directory contains notebooks of the Rag system implementation
    backend/data/: This directory holds any necessary data files, such as training datasets or contract documents. 
    backend/tests/: This directory includes unit tests for the codebase. 
    frontend/: includes the frontend codebase  
    README.md: This file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project. 
    requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.  

# Getting Started
    To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/lillianassefa/Contract-AI-Chatbot.git
   
    cd Contract-AI-Chatbot

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the RAG system

    python src/main.py


# SOURCE CODE
 The initial stage of the rag implementation is written in the backend/notebooks directory. You will find two notebooks with different RAG implemenatations.
 The react app ui can be infered from the frontend directory as well.
